        "description": "This sweet, nutty and smoky seasoning is mapley, bittersweet, earthy, and garlicky. Obviously, you hear fishy and think its only for fish, but give it a try on other seafood like scallops and shrimp. Additionally, this blend is great on meats, tofu or veggies. Personally I love to use this on squash and zucchini.",

        "description": "This salted pepper-based rub is citrusy, licoricey and has herbal aromatic notes. Best on lamb, beef and duck, but also a great addition to slow cooking soups, stews, and roasts. Or sprinkle on vegetables before roasting. It's also great to mix with some olive oil to make a spectacular dip for bread. One of my favorite things to do with this is sprinkle it on some fresh fennel.",

Another all purpose one that I especially like for fusion cooking, this has a little twist on Moroccan flavors adding some bold onion, pepper, and herbal notes. Try this in a stir fry, it's excellent when sprinkled on vegetables or rice. Use it to season some meats or kebabs, even sprinkle some into a soup or salad for a little added something special.",
